      "Hi Girls! It's that time again. We need to get everyone together for our annual Christmas Dinner. I have spoken to many of you and tried to come up with a good time for everyone. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a \"perfect day\", but how about Friday-Dec. 22nd? Please respond and tell me what you think. I have had a few suggestions for a place-Churrasco's, America's, Ruggles, Benji's, Sullivans-please send a suggestion. Don't say it doesn't matter because majority vote will win and there will be no recount. The time will probably be around 8 p.m. I know the 22nd is close to Christmas, so the 19th has also been suggested-but I am afraid not everyone will be in town yet. Please send me your thoughts on the day, restauraunt, and if we should plan something after dinner. I can't wait to see everyone and hope all can make it! -Laura\n",

      "EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron. They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis. EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE. Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds. I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.\n",

      "I do not believe the Alaghband issue was researched for the first deal; however, the two deals are vastly different from each other. The first deal (with Webco JV) was a 1 year inventory management deal in which we had title to the product the entire time. That risk profile contrasts sharply with a 15 year option with a $40MM unsecured loan. Per our London team, the deal does not break even until year 7, and much of the value is in the tail. Clearly, a higher level of due diligence should be required. Additionally, Paul Maley does not have pro-forma data on the merged Balli-Klockner entity - just a company prepared presentation. Balli is purely a trading company, and it is our understanding that Klockner is largely the same; the new entity is projected to be extremely leveraged.

      "Hi Gerry, I don't remember anyone signing a notice of lien in Arizona. I remember seeing a bunch of lien notices, since they have to send a notice even if payment isn't due yet. I always thought that was strange, and sure created clutter. I can't remember if there was any requirement that we sign. Does Dewey remember? If you didn't sign and Dewey didn't sign, that doesn't leave many folks who would have done so. I guess they could have changed the laws, though. Sorry I'm not more help. I've forgotten more than I've remembered. If you are near town this evening, we are celebrating Paige's 21st birthday at Keneally's, staring around 7. I'll buy. I can't believe she is 21.

He has sent us a twenty day notice to file a lien. There is no dispute but he is sending the notice anyway. I understand all of that. My question is this----it asks for us (BE&K) to sign and acknowledge receipt of the notice. It doesn't exactly read like I am required to acknowledge receipt. What do you think or remember?

      "Dear Joe, Would it be possible for you to come in one day next week at about 3:00 p.m. to go over your discovery responses? Alternatively, you could come in two days at 4:00 p.m. On Thursday, I leave early for my son's soccer practice. Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would be good for you??? Jonda L.
