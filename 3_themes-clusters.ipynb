delivery on expectations of more demand at the start of the new week as well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures were forecast to dip even further Some parties also claimed that a rise in the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily electricity market It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity market there was no volatility and no liquidity But next week could prove to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes said one marketer on Friday Following last Monday auction for a percent ownership stake in the company trading arm Enron chose to have Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying but company lawyers said they will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on Monday The move was designed to restore market confidence in the gas and electricity marketing giant Enron shares were suspended since the NYSE opened on Friday pending news on the deal Andersen the accounting firm for Enron remains in hot water following news that the firm violated one of the accounting profession basic auditing standards by destroying several Enron documents There are still many questions surrounding the destroyed documents including who shredded them when and exactly why The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm all for the sake of Enron Misery loves company Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as

forecasts for Monday and weaker gas prices at the Socal border electricity prices for the package settled higher in the Golden State on Friday Sunday inclusion usually brings light load prices up but

temperatures from January to prices in the Southwest made their typical rise for power but some parties were surprised by the amount of strength seen Prices were up quite a bit which surprised me

chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself Chris Trautman LaCrosse WI I am stuck on my last starter Should I go with Shaun Alexander or WRs and start Marty Booker Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts but now he faces a team that may not back down to him The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin Miami will be fired up to face Alexander who may have his first forgettable game as a starter Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary and is not destined to have a big day Neither player seems like a great start but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems Mark MacKay San Diego CA Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week Rod had a good Week Six but Ike is looking better each week Gardner huge day means two things One he gains instant Fantasy notice Two his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study The Giants have been very solid defensively and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form and might be the Giants No receiver if Amani Toomer is benched He be facing Champ Bailey though so Hilliard is not due for a big week Neither player looks like a great start but we go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement John Kersey Denver CO I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson Who should I start as my No RB Jason Brookins Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him so he is a risky start It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week but he will face a respectable run defense Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at

      "California Wary of Dynegy Bid to Buy Out Enron Energy Both companies are prominent players in the state power market The move to combine their strength is raising some concerns By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS TIMES STAFF WRITER November Dynegy of Houston has been hailed as a hero on Wall Street as it rides to deliver rival Enron from its ills and save energy markets from serious distress through its proposed buyout of the world largest energy trader But in California Dynegy has a different image Dynegy of several Southern California power plants has been the quietest member of the Big Five group of energy producers commonly portrayed as villains by California politicians and regulators Gov Gray Davis and others have called Dynegy and its fellow energy suppliers gougers and pirates who manipulated the market and charged too much for electricity precipitating California energy crisis Partly because of the heightened political sensitivities to all things surrounding California energy problems the state is expected to play a central role in the proposed merger between Dynegy and Enron antitrust experts and others say The state Attorney General office already has begun scrutinizing the proposed combination If it merges with Enron another favorite Davis target Dynegy would be a powerhouse in energy trading electricity generation and natural gas transmission And the combined firm would have a strong presence in California which some find troubling I would hope that the people who look at the antitrust implications would consider this one carefully said state Steve Peace Cajon one of the architects of California failed foray into electricity deregulation who became a fierce critic of power producers and resellers If anything Dynegy would be in an even stronger position to be able to manipulate markets than it was before Dynegy agreed on to buy Enron through a stock swap valued at about billion and to inject billion into crumbling Enron provided by ChevronTexaco the San oil company that owns nearly of Dynegy But a continuing trickle of disturbing financial disclosures keep slamming Enron stock price indicating that investors have their doubts that the deal will be completed as negotiated The Enron purchase would hurl Dynegy which is about a quarter of Enron size into the top ranks of energy merchants In California energy world Dynegy already is a key company At every significant twist in the state energy crisis Dynegy was there although not as visibly as some of the other owners and electricity resellers Enron and Reliant Energy also of Houston and Duke Energy of Charlotte drew particular fire from politicians and consumer advocates during the last months as energy leaped higher But Dynegy also was accused by the state grid operator of reaping excessive profit through its electricity bidding practices and to a lesser extent by holding back some electricity from its Southern California power plants In addition Dynegy signed electricity contracts with the state that have been singled out by critics for containing potentially lucrative clauses requiring that the state pay emissions costs and other costs The California Independent System Operator which runs the power transmission grid serving much of the state has asked federal regulators to ban Dynegy from selling power at market prices has made the same request concerning the other major power plant owners Duke Reliant Mirant and AES of Arlington which markets its power through an agreement with Williams of Tulsa Dynegy has sort of slid by under the radar said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer Consumer Rights a consumer activist group Not only did Dynegy do very well but particularly its trading and marketing division did very well over the course of the last two years It profited wildly For its part Dynegy rejects accusations of market manipulation saying it has played a constructive role in the California marketplace stepping forward to be one of the first companies to sign contracts with the state when its need was greatest despite an electricity debt of million owed the company by the state and its utilities Dynegy has acted ethically and responsibly in California said Dynegy spokesman John Sousa The fundamental problem in California is that supply did not keep up with demand Dynamic Energy Accused of Overcharging Dynegy was created in as a natural gas trading operation known as Natural Gas Clearinghouse to take advantage of the deregulation of natural gas prices Under Chief Executive Chuck Watson the company has expanded into natural gas processing and distribution and electricity generation changing its name along the way to Dynegy a word created by combining dynamic and energy In California Dynegy owns power plants capable of generating megawatts of electricity through a partnership with NRG Energy of Minneapolis A megawatt can supply about average homes with electricity The state big utilities were required to sell some of their power plants by the landmark deregulation legislation By the end of the partnership had purchased three large power plants in Long Beach El Segundo and San Diego and a collection of small peaker plants from Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas Electric Co Under the arrangement between the partnership NRG operates the power plants and Dynegy markets the electricity from them It is Dynegy bidding practices in selling that power into state markets that put it along with other energy producers on the wrong side of the state grid operator and federal energy regulators Among the allegations In a report released in March accused energy producers and resellers including Dynegy of overcharging Californians by billion between May and March Power suppliers have denied the allegations The report also found that Dynegy reaped about million in monopoly rents between May and November of last year or profits beyond what a competitive market would bear That was the total for any company noted in the report Enron was ranked sixth taking million in such profits said Dynegy maximized profits primarily through a practice known as economic withholding or bidding electricity at prices so high that they would be rejected thereby pushing up the price charged for the remaining generation sold into the market Dynegy also did some physical withholding said meaning that the company withheld electricity supplies to drive up the price Dynegy was accused last April in hearings before state legislators of hoarding space on a key natural gas pipeline into California in and causing natural gas prices to soar Dynegy executives testified that the charge was untrue When federal regulators ordered million in potential refunds for the first four months of the year Dynegy portion was the largest among the power sellers named representing slightly more than one third Dynegy said its prices were justified by high natural gas prices emissions costs and other factors Dynegy President Stephen Bergstrom said in April that the company was unfairly and inaccurately accused of withholding power from the California market As we have repeatedly communicated to California policymakers and regulators and to industry officials we remain ready and willing to generate and sell power to any and all buyers at fair and reasonable prices when they are able to provide appropriate assurances that they will fulfill their obligation to pay for those purchases A recent report by the state Department of Water Resources backs up Dynegy assertions that its prices have been in line with the rest of the market During the first three months of this year after prices pushed Edison and PG E so close to insolvency that the state had to step in and buy power for their customers Dynegy sold power to the DWR at an average price of per for electricity That was slightly below the average of per charged by all sellers Dynegy portrays itself as a minor player in the California market representing about of the state generation But in asking federal regulators to revoke Dynegy authority to sell power at market rates said Dynegy has profited systematically from the exercise of market power to the significant harm of California electric consumers and economy A decision is pending Officials reviewing the merger will closely review the companies operations in California Although Enron owns no power plants in California it is believed to have contracts with some generators although spokesman Eric Thode refused to detail them In addition Enron has a hand in of the energy trades around the nation with a significant portion of that in California Thode would not detail California operations citing company policy Finally Enron controls an undetermined amount of natural gas which is used to generate about of the state electricity through its transwestern pipeline which crosses into California and through natural gas marketing and trading arrangements It is those largely unregulated energy trading operations that have many energy watchdogs worried They say that middlemen such as Enron and Dynegy can drive up the price of power by reselling it at higher prices each time A lawsuit filed in May against the Big Five generators by Gov Cruz Bustamante acting as a private citizen described it this way The Dynegy trading floor working with the trading floors operated by Williams Mirant Reliant and Duke Energy is one of the principal tools the defendants used to inflate the price of electricity within their respective markets as well as throughout the state of California These defendants engaged in trading of electricity futures forwards options and other risk products that had the effect of manipulating and inflating the price of electricity within their respective markets the suit charged These defendants engaged in laundering in which they made trades with the primary purpose of inflating the costs of electricity within their respective markets State Is Examining Proposed Merger California Atty Bill Lockyer has begun examining what effects such a merger would have on California spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also will scrutinize the merger in a process that Dynegy and Enron expect will take no more than nine months Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen del Rey said she plans to urge FERC to look beyond traditional measurements of how much the companies own in the market to examine inputs into the market such as gas pipeline capacity controlled by the companies and gas trading by Dynegy and Enron It really raises many questions about how the market works Bowen said Opposition by California could be a severe hindrance to the merger said Garret Rasmussen a lawyer with Patton Boggs in Washington and formerly a Federal Trade Commission antitrust investigator The state if it chooses could play as pivotal a role as it has in negotiations over the antitrust settlement between the federal government and Microsoft he said While this administration has been quite tolerant of mergers an action by the California attorney general could have a significant chance of success Rasmussen said Merger Might Reopen Contract Negotiation The proposed merger might give California leverage to renegotiate its power contract with Dynegy which contains the unusual provision that the state would pay for any emission costs that the company incurred said John White director of the Center for Energy Efficiency Renewable Technologies in Sacramento Dynegy large San Diego plant lacks crucial pollution control equipment he said The California attorney general needs to carefully examine Dynegy environmental stewardship activities and renegotiate that provision in the contract White said Dynegy has a Texas attitude as far as the environment is concerned David Freemen the former Los Angeles Department of Water Power general manager who helped negotiate Dynegy and other contracts said that while opportunities to renegotiate may present themselves the agreements now maligned as too expensive were key to stabilizing the electricity market Freeman praised Dynegy for its part in that process There a difference between companies that bargained hard with us and reached agreement like Dynegy Calpine and Williams and those that were reaching for the moon and we did reach agreement Freeman said Dynegy knew that they wanted to do business in California and do it in a businesslike manner For information about

      "ISDA PRESS REPORT OCTOBER CREDIT DERIVATIVES ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery IFR TRADING PRACTICE Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients Financial Times WEATHER DERIVATIVES Every cloud FOW ISDA clears way for Railtrack convertible delivery IFR October A UK lawyer retained by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association last Thursday advised that convertible bonds in their normal form meet the clause of ISDA standard credit derivatives definitions This cleared the way for banks to accept delivery of Railtrack convertible under existing default swaps Around of convertibles had been delivered under default swap exercises by the close of trading on Friday Although banks and other protection sellers will now realise some losses on acceptance of the Railtrack convertible compared with accepting Railtrack straight debt the advice from Robin Potts QC was welcomed by the heads of credit derivatives at the major dealers The legal opinion in effect removes one of the last main uncertainties about the enforceability of default swaps and should allow increased sales of credit derivatives to convertible bond buyers The market has demonstrated its maturity said the head of credit derivatives trading at one bank All the major houses are now accepting convertibles as deliverables A lawyer was chosen to provide the advice because the UK is the regime with the main legal question marks about deliverability of convertible bonds under default swap contracts as well as the home of Railtrack European convertibles typically feature a trustee with the responsibility to exercise conversion rights if a stock price moves a certain way beyond the strike price on a convertible bond Banks had worried that this widows and orphans feature of convertible bonds could be interpreted to mean that the holder of a bond did not have full rights over its disposal and that the deal would not therefore be deliverable under standard default swap language The finding that convertibles are not contingent whether they have a trustee or not and therefore are deliverable under default swaps unless specified otherwise brought the price of the convertible bond closer to that of the cheapest to deliver of Railtrack straight bonds its issue The convertible had been trading as low as early last week while the bond had been trading around By the close of trading on Friday however the convertible was priced at bid only while the bond was at Assuming that default swap exercises were around these levels the total cost to protection sellers of the Potts opinion would have been roughly when comparing the cost of accepting of the convertible with delivery of the straight bond This cost will rise slightly as the gap between the prices of the convertible and the straight issue is likely to narrow further before more exercises are completed Bank derivatives heads generally view the cost as negligible compared with the benefit of some assurance that convertibles are deliverable The advice from Potts does not carry the same weight as a court judgement but as the price of the convertible has appreciated there is little chance that an end investor in a synthetic securitisation or note will mount a legal challenge to try to stop a bank from accepting delivery of the convertible The banks that arrange these structured trades normally have the responsibility for handling any default swap exercises on the credits included ISDA will soon unveil new detailed guidance on credit derivatives written on convertible debt including the zerocoupon bonds that have been a major feature of issuance this year Investment banks offer derivatives services to clients Financial Times October By John Labate JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank are the latest firms to offer new derivatives services to their clients The two investment banks are expected to announce the first licensing agreements today with Longitude a online derivatives platform that will also launch today The agreements give both firms exclusive licenses to offer derivatives trading in a unique series of products Derivative services allow companies and other institutions to offset the risks that are inherent in a number of their investments or commercial activities Traditionally the risks that have been hedged have been limited to things traded already such as stocks bonds or currencies Longitude was founded in and offers a service to run hedging services for events of economic significance that can not be hedged currently in the derivatives markets according to chief executive Andrew Lawrence Mr Lawrence a former hedge fund executive says in its initial phase the company will offer JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank clients derivatives and risk management services for economic statistics In the near term other derivatives services will be launched through Longitude to hedge the weather equity prices mortgage payments data central bank target rates and to cover other areas JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank did not state the amounts of their spending for their licenses or the length of those contracts with Longitude This differentiates us as a provider of derivatives products said Chris Harvey managing director at JP Morgan There is no direct mechanism in the capital markets for clients to take views or hedge exposure to underlying economic variables Longitude founders designed the system to simulate auction systems where prices were set without the need to match buyers and sellers in the market The system is similar to betting that occurs at horse tracks where the prices are based on all bets Once the hedged event occurs the many separate claims are paid from the hedges placed in the system Every cloud FOW October It would have been tempting in to believe that the art of financial risk management had reached a zenith That was the year innovative energy companies demonstrated that derivatives could be used to hedge the financial impact of one of the most powerful and unpredictable variables confronting business managers Mother Nature According to the US Department of Commerce at least trillion of the US economy is sensitive to the vagaries of the weather including vast portions of the energy manufacturing retailing tourism and agriculture industries Yet it was only with the development of weather derivatives that companies gained the ability to protect their financial results from significant but weather events such as excessive heat precipitation or wind risks that few traditional insurance policies could efficiently cover Today it is clear that the trading of the world first weather derivative a temperature collar executed between Koch Industries and Enron marked the dawn of a new era in risk management not the crowning of an old one It signaled the creation of a trading market fundamentally more efficient than insurance which after all requires insurers to retain their clients risk and to charge a risk premium for providing that service A trading market by contrast matches principals on either side of a risk eliminating the need for a risk premium The result is a less costly more efficient means of risk transfer Not surprisingly companies whose financial results are sensitive to the weather have been flocking to this new market The cumulative notional value of all weather derivatives executed since exceeds billion Meanwhile traders are continuing to develop a seemingly endless stream of new products that give companies the opportunity to hedge all sorts of risks once considered unmanageable from advertising costs to river flows However it is obvious that this new market still confronts numerous challenges Whole industries need to be educated in the use and value of derivatives Governments in the US and abroad must be shown that solutions to risk management can be more effective and more efficient for consumers than regulatory solutions Some US regulators still allow utilities to recoup the cost of bad weather from their ratepayers through inefficient weather normalisation clauses for example In some regions of the world and some market niches data for indices that underlie these new products must become more rigorously standardised and more widely available Despite these challenges the opportunities are nearly limitless The past has shown that nearly any product service or business variable that can be measured can be commoditised and that anything that can be commoditised can be traded Enron began proving this idea in when deregulation of the natural gas industry was forcing companies to change the way they contracted for gas in the wholesale market That year Enron executed the world first swap to meet the needs of a customer that wanted to lock in a fixed price for its gas purchases To make the deal work Enron agreed to absorb the cost or benefit of monthly spot gas purchases tied to a published index Five years after creating what would become the precursor to today wholesale gas trading business Enron began migrating its gas trading expertise into other markets beginning with electrical power In it completed the world first weather trade Two years later the company newly formed Enron Broadband Services unit debuted its Enron Intelligent Network an Internet application delivery platform that later led to Enron first bandwidth trade That year also marked the launch of EnronOnline There companies can buy and sell a vast array of physical commodities and related derivatives contracts in markets as diverse as natural gas power emission allowances bandwidth weather derivatives NGLs petrochemicals and plastics coal crude oil pulp and paper credit derivatives shipping steel and metals However the idea of hedging risk with derivatives is not a new one As early as the century vendors at European trade fairs were signing contracts for future delivery of goods Futures contracts were part of tulip mania in Holland in the early In that same century the Japanese created a futures market in rice at Dojima near Osaka to protect sellers from bad weather or warfare In the Chicago Board of Trade began trading wheat pork belly and copper futures Today the range of commodities and risks that can be traded are limited only by imagination and determination The weather market A closer look at the development of the weather market illustrates the opportunity According to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Weather Risk Management Association the number of weather contracts executed in the months ended April rose by to from the comparable period While the total notional value of weather derivatives traded during that time declined to billion the downturn appears to have been a consequence of happenstance in this case mild temperatures during the winters of and in North America where more than of all contracts were executed Those temperate winters the survey managers theorise likely caused buyers of weather derivatives to demand less protection against the possibility of an unusually cold winter in While weather contracts remain for the moment the most popular type of weather derivative there are signs that the market is broadening While contracts accounted for of all contracts traded during the first three years of the market development for example contracts linked to other measures accounted for of all contracts written during the six months ended April We can expect this broadening of the market to continue as new products give companies the power to more precisely hedge their risks Prime examples introduced recently include power demand swaps and options Demand swaps are designed to overcome one of the biggest pitfalls of weather derivatives they can protect companies against swings in demand for the products they sell or the raw materials they consume only to the extent that demand is impacted by the weather Demand swaps by contrast protect companies from fluctuations in demand regardless of the cause making them a more flexible and in some cases more accurate hedging tool Power demand swaps allow companies that buy and sell electricity to their demand or consumption exposure within a specified power pool in the US Suppose for example that a power aggregator serving customers in the PJM pool routinely buys its power in the forward market When demand exceeds the norm the aggregator is forced to purchase additional power in the open market generally at inflated prices With demand swaps the aggregator can receive payments from Enron when weekly demand within its pool exceeds the average In exchange it would agree to make payments to Enron when weekly demand is below average When it is required to make payouts it can offset their cost in part by selling some of its excess power back into the market For utilities uncomfortable with the cost of a swap Enron also offers power demand options that limit costs to the premium paid for the option options protect companies against both price and volume volatility simultaneously Unlike a traditional weather derivative which pays out a specified amount of cash per unit of weather these new contracts pay out based on the difference between the market price of an underlying commodity such as energy and a contracted strike price for that commodity The payout is still triggered however by a weather variable Here a example In July a Midwestern utility began searching for protection against the adverse financial impact of a warmer than normal winter Per its custom the utility wished to purchase its gas for the upcoming winter in advance via the futures market and to lock in a sufficient quantity to cover the coldest possible winter The downside of this strategy is that if the winter proves unseasonable mild the utility would be left with a long gas position in a soft market Not only would the utility sell less gas to its customers than anticipated it would probably have to sell gas back into the spot market at deflated prices Under the terms of a contract the utility entered into with Enron it will receive compensation if the number of heating degree days the cumulative number of degrees below from November through March is below a predetermined strike The amount of compensation is dependent upon the market price of gas at the beginning of each month covered by the contract Enron through what are effectively put options settled in cash will pay the utility the difference between the market price of gas that month and a strike price equal to what the utility paid in the futures market Growing global While most weather derivatives have been traded in the US they have already begun to migrate overseas into Oslo Tokyo Sydney and London Other important players are entering the market too They include most notably large financial institutions Goldman Sachs in the US Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank in Germany and Credit Lyonnais in France The importance of their participation in this new market rests to a large degree on the relationships they have with their clients relationships founded in part on trust Because of that trust companies already doing business with these banks may be more receptive to entering what is for most of them a novel marketplace In addition these banks can offer their clients incentives to use weather derivatives in the form of reduced lending rates a reward reflecting the fact that users of weather derivatives generally enjoy smoother more predictable financial results than their competitors who do not use them A final factor driving the growth of the weather derivatives market is the increasing pressure companies are getting from lenders and investors to make use of these instruments Now that companies can control the financial impact of adverse weather conditions they are finding it increasingly hard to justify any failure to do so of ISDA Press Report for October THE ISDA PRESS REPORT IS PREPARED FOR THE

next week game remains uncertain All I know is from week to week they increase his exercises and change of direction head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida It remains to be n when Fred will be able

need to start him every week in your league Bettis is likely to struggle against a decent Titans rush defense on Sunday but he still give you serviceable stats and may even find the end zone Curtis Conway WR SD Blue Balls Updated Expect a big game from Conway in Week The Arizona pass defense has been very soft all year long Kordell Stewart QB PIT Team Dick Updated While the Steelers passing game has improved in recent weeks Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basis He faces a weak Tennessee secondary on Sunday which is a good matchup but only use him if you desperate for a starter in your league Darrell Jackson WR SEA Grid Iron Goons Updated Jackson should play very well at Kansas City this week Seattle will use their passing game early on to open up running lanes for Shaun Alexander and Jackson will be a key receiver for Matt Hasselbeck Tim Brown WR OAK Uran Man Updated Raiders QB Rich Gannon should have plenty of time to locate Brown downfield in their game against the Giants on Sunday Definitely get Brown into your active lineup this week Charlie Garner RB OAK Luccis Losers Updated Do expect Garner to put up good stats against the Giants on Sunday Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York is tough on the run Only use Garner if you do have another alternative on your roster David Patten WR NE Grid Iron Goons Updated Patten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday While he has been inconsistent all year long this is a favorable matchup for the wideout Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score and you should consider using him as your No or receiver Troy Brown WR NE Houston Big Ballers Updated Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners this season and has only gotten better since Tom Brady has been throwing him the ball Expect another solid week for Brown against a mediocre Saints secondary Antowain Smith RB NE Team Dick Updated Smith has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season He go up against a subpar Saints rush defense on Sunday and we recommend you get him into your active lineup as a result Oronde Gadsden WR MIA Team Dick Updated Gadsden has been very inconsistent this season and we do recommend you use him this week against the Bills Let him prove himself before you consider putting him back into your active lineup the remainder of the season James McKnight WR MIA Luccis Losers Updated There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few long passes on Sunday However he is only worth using in very deep leagues Travis Minor RB MIA Houston Big Ballers Updated The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season Tony Gonzalez TE KC Grid Iron Goons Updated Gonzalez will rack up good Fantasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks While he has been somewhat of a disappointment you need to keep him active every week Stephen Davis RB WAS Houston Big Ballers Updated Davis rushed for yards against Denver last week and was held out of the end zone once again He may struggle against Philadelphia in Week but you may have no choice but to start him considering the lack of running back depth around the league Larry Parker WR KC Luccis Losers Updated Parker could get a touchdown pass Sunday against Seattle as the Seahawks secondary has regularly been burned by teams second wideout options He might make a good No receiver for this week Tony Richardson RB KC Team Chick Updated Richardson has fallen into a back role in recent games and there a chance he get a score against the Seahawks on Sunday Kansas City should move the ball with relative ease and if you are in a deep league or a league he might be worth putting in your lineup Priest Holmes RB KC Houston Big Ballers Updated The Chiefs will use many plays to keep the Seahawks off balance on Sunday which should help Holmes roll up some very good stats this week We recommend you get him into your active lineup despite his struggles against the Jets in Week Nine Trent Green QB KC Blue Balls Updated Green and the Chiefs slumped badly before their bye week but should rebound Sunday against Seattle Expect him to post decent stats against this questionable secondary but do rush to start him over a less quarterback Stephen Alexander TE WAS Free Agent Updated According to the I Washington Post Alexander will be back in the starting lineup on Sunday against Philadelphia He had been inconsistent prior to suffering an ankle injury so starting him is somewhat of a gamble Kyle Brady TE JAC Free Agent Updated Brady has offered useful Fantasy stats much this season We do recommend you use him this week against the Ravens as it is unlikely this is the game he will break his slump Rod Gardner WR WAS Houston Big Ballers Updated Gardner has been held down in three consecutive weeks and is having some trouble holding onto the ball recently He face a tough Philadelphia secondary on Sunday making him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective Keenan McCardell WR JAC Uran Man Updated McCardell matches up with Duane Starks in Sunday game against Baltimore and that combined with the possibility of Jonathan Quinn starting at quarterback makes him a risky start McCardell has the talent to beat Starks for a few good catches but you should be counting on him for explosive stats Jimmy Smith WR JAC Team Dick Updated Despite Jonathan Quinn likely playing his second straight game you have to keep a guy like Smith active in any week in your league He might have less impressive stats but Smith is still talented enough to catch more passes than most receivers in the league Elvis Joseph RB JAC Free Agent Updated There a chance Joseph could break off some long runs despite his facing the Ravens defense on Sunday However we only recommend you use him this week if you have no other options at running back Marcus Pollard TE IND Really Rottens Updated Pollard will have his hands full trying to escape San Francisco Lance Schulters on Sunday While Pollard has been a very reliable Fantasy tight end in recent weeks you should expect great stats this week However you should probably start him unless you have a good alternative Terrence Wilkins WR IND Free Agent Updated Wilkins is likely to start in place of the injured Reggie Wayne Sunday against San Francisco While Wilkins could get some passes thrown his way and post decent stats against a Niners secondary we only recommend you use him if you have no other options at wide receiver Marvin Harrison WR IND Boyz Updated Harrison is a in any Fantasy league regardless of opponent However he should have no problem beating San Francisco CB Ahmed Plummer downfield for great stats this week Dominic Rhodes RB IND President Taft Updated Rhodes has a good matchup in Indianapolis on Sunday and you should definitely start him this week He may not post Edgerrin stats but should give good rushing totals and a score Desmond Clark TE DEN Really Rottens Updated Clark has been getting more passes thrown his way than Dwayne Carswell in recent weeks and he will be a key member of the Broncos passing game Thursday against Dallas While the Cowboys will likely be ready to defend these two tight ends if you need to start one it should definitely be Clark Dwayne Carswell TE DEN Team Chick Updated Carswell might factor into the Broncos passing game more Thursday against Dallas due to a thin corps at wide receiver However he had no catches in similar circumstances in Week and the Cowboys will be ready to defend short passes to him Only use Carswell if you thin at the tight end position Keith Poole WR DEN Orange Roughy Updated If Rod Smith indeed misses Thursday game against Dallas Poole will need to step up as the Broncos top receiving target However we do recommend you use him in a Fantasy league until he first proves himself a reliable Keep Poole reserved against Dallas Kevin Dyson WR TEN Team Chick Updated Do look for good numbers from Dyson this week he has been inconsistent this season and may not do much against a physical Pittsburgh defense Derrick Mason WR TEN Boyz Updated Mason should post respectable statistics against the Steelers Do expect him to be intimidated by the Pittsburgh defense Mike Alstott RB TB Luccis Losers Updated Alstott is once again playing second fiddle to Warrick Dunn so do expect huge Fantasy numbers from him Unless you play in a deeper league starting Alstott is a risk Brad Johnson QB TB DRock Beaatchs Updated Johnson threw for yards last week against Chicago but he also threw no touchdowns and was picked off twice He been unreliable from a Fantasy standpoint and is a gamble even when the matchup is in his favor Keyshawn Johnson WR TB Orange Roughy Updated Johnson had a big game against Chicago last weekend catching passes for yards He was held out of the end zone again but look for that to change on Monday night against Louis Hakim WR STL Luccis Losers Updated Hakim suffered an ankle injury during last Sunday game against New England He listed as questionable for Monday game against Tampa Bay so avoid starting him if at all possible Torry Holt WR STL President Taft Updated Holt had seven receptions for yards and a touchdown last weekend against New England He one of the better Fantasy receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis Isaac Bruce WR STL Uran Man Updated Bruce had a huge game against New England last weekend posting seven catches for yards Look for him to have a solid game in Week against a Tampa Bay defense that is vulnerable to the big play Olandis Gary RB DEN Houston Big Ballers Updated Gary will likely get a fair number of carries Thursday against Dallas but we do expect him to provide useful Fantasy stats The Cowboys will probably focus on the run which makes both Gary and Mike Anderson risky starts this week since they have been splitting time Brian Griese QB DEN Really Rottens Updated With favorite target Rod Smith likely sidelined by injury Griese will have questionable receivers to work with Thursday against Dallas However the Cowboys defense will probably focus on the run and force Griese to beat them through the air He should provide your team with decent stats and is worth using this week Marshall Faulk RB STL Blue Balls Updated Faulk had scrimmage yards and a touchdown against New England last weekend He the best player in Fantasy Football and is a in any league format Jamel White RB CLE Orange Roughy Updated The Browns may use White as a back Sunday against the subpar Bengals run defense You might want to consider him as a third running back option on your team if you lacking in starting options Ernie Conwell TE STL Boyz Updated Conwell has had a few down weeks and is now listed as questionable for Monday game against Tampa Bay due to a shoulder injury With the lack of depth at tight end around the league however starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do if he healthy Kurt Warner QB STL Luccis Losers Updated Warner had a solid game against New England last Sunday throwing for yards and three touchdowns He too good to ever consider benching and will throw at least two touchdowns against Tampa Bay inconsistent secondary Santiago TE CLE Free Agent Updated Santiago catches the occasional pass for the Browns and could find the end zone every now or then He going up against a mediocre Cincinnati secondary so maybe this is one of the rare weeks he scores Only use Santiago if you desperate for a tight end however as he rarely gets a big yardage total Kevin Johnson WR CLE Grid Iron Goons Updated Johnson has been a prime target for Tim Couch in the Cleveland passing game this season and is now a very reliable No or Fantasy receiver Johnson is on a real hot streak and has a good career record against the Bengals his opponent for this week so get him into your lineup Tim Couch QB CLE Team Chick Updated Couch has a decent track record against the Bengals passing yards four TDs whom he will face on Sunday There are plenty worse quarterbacks you could choose from so if you reaching to find a starter this week give him a look Peter Warrick WR CIN Dont Mess Updated Warrick has been catching a fair amount of passes this season but has provided stats worthy of using him on a weekly basis in a Fantasy league His matchup against Cleveland on Sunday is unfavorable so keep him reserved this week Darnay Scott WR CIN Orange Roughy Updated Although Scott has caught a touchdown pass in each of his last two games against the Browns whom he plays Sunday we ca recommend you use him this week He has been far too inconsistent and a real disappointment from a Fantasy perspective Jon Kitna QB CIN Blue Balls Updated We ca advise you use Kitna as he goes up against the Browns secondary this week Cleveland has been very stingy against the pass all year leading the league in interceptions and ranking ninth overall in sacks Corey Dillon RB CIN Texas Terminators Updated Definitely get Dillon into your active lineup as he goes up against the Browns on Sunday He has a great career record against Cleveland rushing yards five rushing TDs in five games Dillon should remain in your active lineup week in and week out in any league Larry Centers RB BUF Boyz Updated Centers has been a great back for the Bills this season but he will face a Miami defense on Sunday that will likely be able to contain him Only use him if you have no other alternative on your bench Peerless Price WR BUF DRock Beaatchs Updated Price has established himself as a solid Fantasy receiver in recent weeks logging yards in three of his last six games He faces a bigger challenge in Miami on Sunday but right now you ca merit reserving him Eric Moulds WR BUF Really Rottens Updated There a good chance that Moulds will be inspired to have a good week against a solid Miami secondary after he voiced disapproval at his recent limited role in the Buffalo passing game Pair that with the fact that he has a good history against the Dolphins four TDs in last six games and he might be worth using as a No or receiver this week Eric Johnson TE SF Free Agent Updated Johnson caught three passes for yards last weekend against Carolina Unless you play in a deeper Fantasy league Johnson is really worth starting at this point Stokes WR SF Uran Man Updated Stokes had a solid game last weekend catching eight passes for yards and two touchdowns against Carolina He been very unreliable overall however so starting him is still a risky move Travis Henry RB BUF Boyz Updated Henry had a very disappointing game against the Seahawks in Week and will likely struggle again against the Dolphins defense on Sunday He has been far too inconsistent to merit using this week Alex Van Pelt QB BUF Luccis Losers Updated Van Pelt is a very risky start on Sunday as he is going up against a strong Dolphins secondary He had a good start last week against the subpar Seahawks but we do forecast him helping carry your team to victory this week despite several injuries to the Miami defense Keep Van Pelt on the bench for Week Travis Taylor WR BAL DRock Beaatchs Updated After a few solid weeks Taylor has returned to his old unproductive self We do expect him to post great stats Sunday against the Jaguars so do use him this week Shannon Sharpe TE BAL Orange Roughy Updated Sharpe has been a very reliable tight end despite having just one receiving touchdown on the season He got seven catches the last time he faced Jacksonville and should get several in their Week matchup Get Sharpe into your active lineup every week Qadry Ismail WR BAL Blue Balls Updated Ismail has become the Ravens lead receiver this season and is quickly developing into a very reliable No Fantasy wideout He is on a real hot streak and has a good history against the Jaguars secondary Make sure you get Ismail into your starting lineup this week Correll Buckhalter RB PHI Uran Man Updated Buckhalter will return from suspension this weekend and will be available for Sunday game against Washington Duce Staley has established himself as the Eagles featured back so starting Buckhalter is a gamble Duce Staley RB PHI Luccis Losers Updated Staley had a solid game against Dallas posting scrimmage yards in Philadelphia win He been on a roll in recent weeks which makes him worth starting in Week against Washington James Thrash WR PHI President Taft Updated Just when you think Thrash is reliable he puts up two catches for yards like he did last weekend against Dallas Thrash will still be in the starting lineups of numberous Fantasy teams but he a gamble nonetheless Ron Dayne RB NYG Texas Terminators Updated Dayne has been a serious disappointment for Fantasy owners in recent weeks He may score a touchdown in situations but he a risky pick for Fantasy owners overall Tiki Barber RB NYG Team Chick Updated Barber has played well recently compiling scrimmage yards and a touchdown in his last two games Oakland has been vulnerable to the run this season so look for the Giants to use Barber prominently in their offense in Week Ike Hilliard WR NYG Luccis Losers Updated Hilliard continues to be a reliable Fantasy player despite playing on a sore toe He may have a tough time against Oakland formidable secondary however especially if Charles Woodson is healthy enough to play Amani Toomer WR NYG Grid Iron Goons Updated Toomer caught five balls for yards against Minnesota on Monday night but he struggle to post similar numbers Oakland The Raiders have a formidable secondary so benching Toomer in smaller Fantasy leagues is a wise move Kerry Collins QB NYG Texas Terminators Updated Collins had a solid game against Minnesota throwing for yards on Monday night However he has had trouble getting the ball into the end zone consistently which makes him a risky Fantasy player As a result benching him in Week against Oakland is advisable Willie Jackson WR NO Texas Terminators Updated Jackson has been somewhat inconsistent as a Fantasy player but he does have the potential to post great numbers every week If you play in a deeper league it worth taking a gamble on Jackson against New England Joe Horn WR NO President Taft Updated Horn is dealing with a number of nagging injuries but he been playing through them quite well In fact Horn has catches for yards and two touchdowns in his last two games and is a in Week against New England based on his potential to post huge numbers Michael Bennett RB MIN Free Agent Updated Bennett is proving all the critics right who said he was ready for the NFL style of game He been a huge Fantasy disappointment and is barely worth a roster spot at this point He do nothing against Chicago aggressive run defense so do bother starting him Daunte Culpepper QB MIN DRock Beaatchs Updated Culpepper finally had a breakout game last week connecting on four touchdown passes against the Giants He should have success against Chicago secondary on Sunday so be sure to include him when you choose your Week starting lineup Cris Carter WR MIN Luccis Losers Updated Carter had catches for yards and a touchdown on Monday night against the Giants proving that he is still a valuable Fantasy player He should have another solid outing on Sunday against Chicago whose pass defense is ranked last in the league Jerome Pathon WR IND Team Dick Updated The Colts placed Pathon on injured reserve Tuesday with a damaged ligament in his right foot effectively ending his season He will undergo surgery in the near future and you should cut him if you were holding onto him awaiting his return Terry Glenn WR NE Grid Iron Goons Updated Glenn did not practice Tuesday or participate in the walkthrough on Wednesday according to published reports He is unlikely to play Sunday against New Orleans and should be on anyone Fantasy roster at this point Byron Chamberlain TE MIN Really Rottens Updated Chamberlain locked up his right knee on Monday night against the Giants but he expected to play this weekend Chicago Chamberlain has been unreliable of late and getting open against Chicago tough linebacking group wo be an easy task Ahman Green RB GB Orange Roughy Updated Green had a huge game against Detroit back in Week One rushing for yards and two touchdowns He a in Week against those same Lions whose defense is questionable at best Schedule Breakdown Current Luccis Losers Luccis Losers at Team

be officially suspended for the remainder of the season y the team league sources told Connell was a major intment for Fantasy leaguers this year Cris Carter Active WR Updated The Lions held Carter to yards on three catches Still the ran receiver is too experienced and potentially productive to bench during any week of the Fantasy playoffs Tiki Barber Reserve RB Updated Barber compiled scrimmage yards against Arizona but he was held of the end zone Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants ffense however and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy layoffs Tom Brady Reserve QB Updated Brady had another ointing game throwing for yards no TDs and an interception at All of a sudden the New England QB appears to be a Fantasy risk during he most important weeks of the

called into question Accounting rms have IMAGE About ZE Energy Views IMAGE IMAGE In our continuous efforts to serve the industry we have developed Energy Views as a platform to ommunicate with the industry on a regular basis in order to relate issues and views we believe to have industry wide relevance We hope you find nefit from reading the emails Any and all feedback is welcome IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE Having the Information and Doing Nothing About It IMAGE E It seems evident that Anderson the government and Enron itself had ivy to a lot of financial data that clearly indicated the eventual e of Enron Andersen contemplated dropping Enron as a client nearly one year ago because of concerns due to Enron accounting methodology The hite House oversaw a study in October of economic repercussions of Enron collapse Sherron Watkins a senior Enron Executive wrote to s chairman Ken Lay I am incredibly nervous that we will implode in a ave of accounting scandals last August The writing was clearly on he wall but most were unable to react to the intelligence It all comes wn to the lemming factor we can see the cliff but just can not avoid ng Many in the industry suffer badly from the chronic inability to ct in a timely manner This failure often results in severe negative mic impacts Either policy is not in place to allow affirmative reaction r staff does not adhere to the policies that exist Good corporate y is the corner stone of sound market participation IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ZEPG Products IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ZE Market lyzer Data Management Suite IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ZE rward Price Views IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE ZE Credit Risk nager IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE About ZE PowerGroup IMAGE IMAGE ZE PowerGroup is a consulting firm that was incorporated to serve the emerging needs of an lectric industry in transition Our company now offers a full spectrum of services from strategic planning and implementation through to analysis and energy trade and transaction software development IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE IMAGE accounting practices to be reative and aggressive while their clients claim that there actions were not unethical with apparent stress on the not part One now marketer has been specifically accused of suspending the rules of ate ethics and perhaps even put corporate morality on vacation Words like scandal allegations suspicions and have become rank in industry CEOs have been asked to leave their positions executives have been forcibly terminated while another commits suicide and the ions continue including criminal ones The situation is sobering It ms like these last few years have been full of bubbles bursting as we all collectively share a cold bath of economic reality The techs tumbled and the stock markets followed the electricity market at least in imploded real bombs are exploding all over the place and the mightiest energy marketer has fallen and it wo be getting back up The biggest ankruptcy in US history will definitely leave its mark on all of us To ink we thought the troubles of PG E and the was big news Levitt former SEC boss suggests that Enron collapse did not occur a vacuum and was was partly a result of a culture of gamesmanship mong businesses that believe it okay to bend the rules This is fundamental folly of the industry as people with limited energy and integrity play games with other peoples money and not or caring about the consequences It is not surprising that the stock ue of other marketers is also beginning to plummet So the question of e day is are you acting prudently It is insufficient to assume that t is right or size is protection Contracting with the largest does not cure your contract no more than using the largest accounting firm your books are right We all leave a paper trail and that trail is e in a moonless night during a California forced blackout even if you er your accounting firm to delete the emails and shred the evidence working with our clients we have come to see that information does not eceive its due respect Perhaps it the fault of the Internet and the ormation overload factor but not respecting information is costly We e witnessed lost deals and poor We have seen the cost of not rigorously following corporate trade risk credit procedures and surely have seen the result of blind faith in the big guys To this end we ely support our clients to equip themselves to effectively manage large ounts of market information Energy market participants more so than rhaps other industries must heed the requirement for prudence For many rudence is a forgotten tradition from the franchise days Prudence in etitive markets which all energy markets are to some degree means a lot more now than it did in the franchise era We are all under the purvey of the public the investor and the regulators Not to recognize this fact n have severe economic ramifications Prudence now means having trade k and credit policies and procedures having the tools to manage and ze data and foremost developing the ability to internally make the right judgment calls Call us to see how ZE PowerGroup can help your on to manage its operation in uncertain markets For more
